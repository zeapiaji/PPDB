          <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
          <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <h3>Example lists</h3>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
          </ol>
          <p>And this is a definition list:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
            <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</dd>
            <dt>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</dt>
            <dd>Used to describe the appearance of Web content</dd>
            <dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
            <dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications</dd>
          </dl>
          <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
          <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langage">HTML</abbr> should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
            <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>
